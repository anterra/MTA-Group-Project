- Please try to use markdown cells in jupyter to document your thought process/explain your steps whenever possible, rather than using inline code comments!
- Use the README.md file sort of like an abstract to a research project -- outline your goal, methods, summary of results, tools used, explanations of the what the different files in the repo are, and the names of members who worked on the project.
